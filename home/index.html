            Hello, welcome! My name is Jasmine, and I'm an 18 year old, hispanic, self-taught artist, writer, and beginner programmer. I'm an amateur artist who's been drawing for almost a decade (digitally half), and I specialize in drawing human/humanoid faces
            and figures in an anime art style. I want to draw characters and create for them a world in which people can invest themselves into. My future is to learn to code, combine all of my skills and interests in order to bring my tale to life. I'm
            extremely proud of all of the progress I've made, and am looking forward to making lots more!
        </p>
